    <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p class="pleft"> Now this is a story all about how My life got flipped turned upside down And I'd like to take a minute, just sit right there I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel-Air In West Philadelphia, born and raised On the playground is where I spent most of my days Chillin' out, maxin', relaxin' all coolAnd all shootin' some b-ball outside of the school When a couple of guys who were up to no good Started makin' trouble in my neighborhood I got in one little fight and my mom got scaredAnd said "You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel-Air"</p>
        
        <p class="pright">I whistled for a cab and when it came near The license plate said 'Fresh' and it had dice in the mirrorIf anything I could say that this cab was rare But I thought "Nah, forget it, yo holmes, to Bel-Air!" I pulled up to the house about 7 or 8 And I yelled to the cabbie "Yo holmes, smell ya later" Looked at my kingdom, I was finally there To sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel-Air</p>
